<h1>DataFrame.apply Considered Harmful</h1>
  <p>
 What follows is a lesson learned from using Python and Pandas for data science. It's probably nothing new, but I wasn't aware of it at first, so there.  Note, I don't actually believe that this function is *harmful* per se, but I do think that you should know what kind of tradeoffs there are in speed.  I think it's just a trope by now to say something is "considered harmful".</p>
<h3>Problem Statement, or, How I Used To Write Pandas Code</h3>
<p>
In my life writing SQL for analysis, I often come across this kind of function:

<pre><code class="sql">SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN a = 'hi' OR b = 'yo' THEN 'case 1'
        WHEN a = 'hi' THEN 'case 2'
        WHEN c > 100 AND c <= 400 THEN 'case 3'
        WHEN c = 0 THEN 'case 4'
        WHEN 'a' IN ('yo', 'what', 'huh') AND b <> 'yo' THEN 'case 5'
        ELSE 'case 6'
    END AS case_fld
FROM
    some_table
</code></pre>

Which is a pattern that's all well and good in relational databases.  (Whether or not it makes for "best practices")</p>

<p>
Replicating this logic seems easy to do in Pandas, by using the "apply" function.  It even looks pretty similar to the SQL syntax:

<pre><code class="python">def naive_case(row):
    if row['a'] == 'hi' or row['b'] == 'yo':
        return 'case 1'
    if row['a'] == 'hi':
        return 'case 2'
    if 100 < row['c'] <= 400:
        return 'case 3'
    if row['c'] == 0:
        return 'case 4'
    if row['a'] in ('yo', 'what', 'huh') and row['b'] != 'yo':
        return 'case 5'
    else:
        return 'case 6'

df['case_fld'] = df.apply(naive_case, axis=1)
</code></pre>

This pattern also seems to work out well, and generates accurate results. But what happens when you run this code over a dataframe with "big" data? Note, not BIG big data, but let's say a million rows. Small enough to fit in memory, but large enough that you start thinking
about performance.  Let's try it out, shall we?  Building a random dataframe with some data in it:

<pre><code class="python">import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import time

a_list = ['hi', 'yo', 'what', 'huh', 'weird']
b_list = ['yo', 'hi']
c_list = [0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700]
size = 1000000
test_frame = pd.DataFrame({
    'a': np.random.choice(a_list, size=size),
    'b': np.random.choice(b_list, size=size),
    'c': np.random.choice(c_list, size=size)
    })

start_time = time.time()
test_frame['d'] = test_frame.apply(naive_case, axis=1)
print('Naive: {0:.2f}'.format(time.time() - start_time))
</code></pre>
The <code>apply</code> function runs in <strong>34.44 seconds</strong> (all times are running on a macbook pro).  Not about to win any races.
</p>
<h3>What's better?</h3>
<p>
I can't remember where I read it now, but the best advice I've seen about Pandas is to get the notion of a *row* out of your head, and think about things in terms of *columns*.  In a non-columnar relational database, you can safely keep the idea of a row in your head when you're calculating things, but in Pandas you want to think of calculations as vector calculations on columns.  As such, you can reformat the above <code>CASE</code> statement into a series of functions on the columns of your dataframe:
<pre><code class="python">def series_case(dataframe):
    a_hi = dataframe['a'] == 'hi'
    b_yo = dataframe['b'] == 'yo'
    c_in_range = (dataframe['c'] > 100) & (dataframe['c'] <= 400)
    c_0 = dataframe['c'] == 0
    a_in_list = dataframe['a'].isin(('yo', 'what', 'huh'))

    #First create a dummy series that you'll return, with your "ELSE" value
    to_return = pd.Series(['case 6'] * dataframe.shape[0], index=dataframe.index)
    
    #Then "roll-up" your case statement
    to_return.loc[a_in_list & -b_yo] = 'case 5'
    to_return.loc[c_0] = 'case 4'
    to_return.loc[c_in_range] = 'case 3'
    to_return.loc[a_hi] = 'case 2'
    to_return.loc[a_hi | b_yo] = 'case 1'

    return to_return

start_time = time.time()
test_frame['e'] = series_case(test_frame)
print('Series: {0:.2f}'.format(time.time() - start_time))
</code></pre>
This version completed in <strong>0.33 seconds</strong>!  One percent of the time of the <code>df.apply</code> version!  That's amazing!
</p>
<p>
A couple of things to call out here:
<ul>
    <li>You have to "reverse" the logic in your <code>CASE</code> statement - the logic is coded "backwards" compared to the SQL version.</li>
    <li>I like the first 5 lines of the function where it's defining a few boolean arrays - this is optional and you could put <code>to_return.loc[dataframe['c'] == 0] = 'case 4'</code> for example, but I think splitting them out helps with readability and testability.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>What about Series.apply?</h3>
<p>My next question was whether the same speedups would be seen when Pandas was just <code>apply</code>-ing a function on one column.  So for this example I want to calculate <code>5x^2 + 2.4x + 18.3</code> for some column x:
<pre><code class="python">def naive_func(value):
    return 5 * value ** 2 + 2.4 * value + 18.3

def series_func(series):
    return 5 * series ** 2 + 2.4 * series + 18.3

size = 50000000
naive_frame = pd.DataFrame({'a': np.random.uniform(size=size)})
series_frame = naive_frame.copy()

start_time = time.time()
naive_frame['b'] = naive_frame['a'].apply(naive_func)
print('Naive: {0:.2f}'.format(time.time() - start_time))

start_time = time.time()
series_frame['b'] = series_func(series_frame['a'])
print('Series: {0:.2f}'.format(time.time() - start_time))
</code></pre>
The <code>Series.apply</code> version takes <strong>20.4 seconds</strong> to run on 50 million records here, while the series version takes <strong>1.31 seconds</strong>.  Not as extreme of a speedup here, but it's still only ~6% of the time.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
I'm pretty keen to completely avoid the <code>apply</code> functions in Pandas.  There may be places where you need to use it, but I would recommend you at very least do some testing!
