<h1>Monopoly Junior Party... and Python!</h1>
<img src="/static/monopoly/box.jpg">

<hr>
<p>
My son is four years old, and he got a copy of the Monopoly Junior Party edition board game as a gift.
That means that I get to play Monopoly Junior Party with a four-year-old!  And while I do really (actually)
enjoy playing with my kid, and he's learning things about dice, counting and capitalism, a couple of things
rankle:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Our copy of the game came without money.  Monopoly, with no money!</li>
  <li>The first ~10 times I played the game with my son, I lost, and it wasn't even close.  To the point
  where he kept offering to just <em>give</em> me money so we could keep playing.  But this game wasn't
  designed to show the evils of <em>socialism</em>, so I turned him down.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first issue I could solve by using real money, so we cracked open my coin jar to get a bunch of quarters
out.  The second issue seemed more interesting - my son always went first, because I didn't want to have
an argument with him about who got to go first.  I started thinking about Jake VanderPlas'
<a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/12/18/simulating-chutes-and-ladders/">excellent analysis of chutes and ladders</a>,
and wondered if I could figure out whether the gameboard was tilted in his favour.
</p>

<h2>Enter Python</h2>

<p>
Monopoly Junior Party is way simpler than
<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Monopoly-B0324-Game-Star-Wars/dp/B00SDJG6QC">real Monopoly</a>, and there's almost no
decisions that need to be made during the game.  If you land on a <del>property</del> <em>party</em> square, you have
to buy it.  You can't trade or sell <del>properties</del> <em>parties</em>.  There's no such thing as houses and hotels.
People have written <a href="http://www.amnesta.net/monopoly/">extensively</a> about how to win at "real" Monopoly,
but for me it's pretty much dumb luck.</p>

<p>
Since there's no real decisions to make, I figured it'd be pretty easy to just simulate a whole game in
Python.  It's a nice way to get a quick introduction to Python 3.7's
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html">dataclasses</a> too, which I'd been planning
on playing around with.  So one afternoon while my kids were napping/having quiet time, I busted out the
game board and coded up the game structure in Python.
</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>
I wound up with a <code>Player</code> and <code>Game</code> class, a couple of yaml files with square and chance card settings
in them, and a bit of wrapper code to run a random game.  See the
<a href="https://github.com/theianrobertson/monopoly-junior/blob/master/main.py">main.py</a> file to check out
what the code looks like.
</p>

<p>
I used Python's <code>dataclasses.dataclass</code> class decorator for the <code>Player</code> class,
and it's kinda nice.  The feature definitely cut down on the number of times I had to write each
parameter and "self", which was nice.  Compare the dataclass version:</p>

<pre><code class="python">@dataclass
class Player:
    name: str
    money: int
    squares_owned: set
    current_square: int = 0
    presents: int = STARTING_PRESENTS
    in_jail: bool = False
    has_get_out_of_jail_card: bool = False
</code></pre>

<p>To how it would have looked without dataclasses:</p>

<pre><code class="python">class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, money):
        self.name = name
        self.money = money
        self.squares_owned = set()
        self.current_square = 0
        self.presents = STARTING_PRESENTS
        self.in_jail = False
        self.has_get_out_of_jail_card = False
</code></pre>
<p>
And how the object <code>__repr__</code> looks with a dataclass:
</p>

<pre><code class="python">Player(name='Ian', money=18, squares_owned=set(), current_square=0, presents=8, in_jail=False, has_get_out_of_jail_card=False)
</code></pre>

<p>
vs. without:
</p>

<pre><code class="python"><__main__.Player object at 0x101c66588>
</code></pre>

<p>With a bit of work, I hacked together a way to churn through a bunch of games to figure out who is
  more likely to win.</p>

<h2>Simulations</h2>

<p>The big question I wanted to answer was whether the board was unfairly tilted in my son's favour.
To figure that out, I ran a 100,000 games and checked whether my son (player 1, went first) or me
(player 2, went second) won more.  A game ends when someone runs out of money.  To figure out the
winner, you add up all the money you have left over, and add one point for every <del>property</del> party you own, and
the player with the highest total wins.  That calculation means that ties are possible, even with only two
players.</p>

<p>Without further ado, the player that moves first won 52.6% of games, and the second player won
47.9% of games (over 100% total because of ties).  So there is an advantage, but it's not as strong
as I'd suspected:</p>

<h3>What about when my daughter is old enough to play?</h3>

<p>
I have a daughter that just turned one.  What happens when I eventually play against both of my kids?
Running the simulation again but with three players, and player one won 40.0% of games, player two
won 34.8% of games, and player three (let's face it, that'll be me) only won a measly 30.5% of games.
Now <em>that</em> is unfair.</p>
<img src="/static/monopoly/game_winners_3.png">

<p>If I were to rope my wife in to the game too and all four of us played, player one still won 33.2%
  of all simulated games, and player four (still, probably me) only wins 21%.  That's almost 60% more!
</p>

<p>Suffice to say, I'm getting the raw end of this Monopoly game.</p>

<h3>Game Lengths</h3>
<p>
If I'm going to settle in to losing at Monopoly, I might as well know what I'm in for.  Luckily, most
games are faster than games of real Monopoly, with most finishing within 25 moves or so:
</p>
<img src="/static/monopoly/game_length_2_player.png">
<p>The fastest games are typically where someone gets unlucky enough to jump to the "expensive" parties
  (at least they're expensive for the 4-year-old set),
  then lands on a bunch of them, quickly draining their bank account.  Inexplicably, a fairly tame
  Beach Party costs 5 dollars, more expensive than a Movie Party at
  1 dollar.  This game, for example, lasts only nine moves!<p>
<pre>son rolled chance|{'type': 'goto-and-get', 'colour': 'red'} bought Clown Party
dad rolled 4|dad --> Swimming Party bought!
son rolled 6|son --> Spooky Party bought!
dad rolled 5|dad --> Party Box
son rolled 1|son --> Safari Party bought!
dad rolled 1|dad --> Pizza Party bought!
son rolled 2|son --> Beach Party bought!
dad rolled 1|dad --> PiÃ±ata Party bought!
son rolled 1|son --> Theme Park Party bought!
</pre>

<p>Player one (my son) gets the Clown Party for free, then has to buy Spooky ($4), Safari ($4), Beach ($5)
  and Theme Park ($5) Parties.  That's enough to wipe out the $18 starting credits, and get me back
to the couch.</p>

<h3>Can I quickly tell if I'm going to lose?</h3>
<p>Another thing I wanted to look into was whether there's a move or a few moves right off the bat
  in the game that would set me up to lose (or swing the pendulum back to my side).  So going back to
  the results from a two-player game, I checked the
  win distribution based on the set of first two moves (6 x 6 = 36 possible combinations):</p>
<ul>
  <li>When ('son rolled 1', 'dad rolled 5'), son won 46.27%</li>
  <li>When ('son rolled 1', 'dad rolled 2'), son won 47.95%</li>
  <li>When ('son rolled 1', 'dad rolled 4'), son won 49.37%</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>When ('son rolled 1', 'dad rolled 1'), son won 57.75%</li>
  <li>When ('son rolled 4', 'dad rolled 4'), son won 58.73%</li>
  <li>When ('son rolled 2', 'dad rolled 2'), son won 60.19%</li>
  <li>When ('son rolled 5', 'dad rolled 5'), son won 60.90%</li>
</ul>
<p>My best chance to win is to leap out in front of my son. If he rolls a one and I pass him on the first
  move, I have a better than 50% chance of winning.  My worst chances come when I land on the same
  <del>property</del> party as he does right away.</p>

<h3>How can I tell mid-game though?</h3>
<p>Next thing I wanted to check was which <del>properties</del> parties were most associated with winning,
  so that if my son got one of them I can give up more hope of winning.  Turns out the most expensive
  <del>properties</del> parties, the Beach and Theme Park parties are the most valuable too - if you
  wind up owning one of them your chances of winning are 60%!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This simulation and analysis was more fun than playing Monopoly.</p>
